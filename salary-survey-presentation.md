# Welcome
Using the data from a table of salary survey data, we will find the industries that are most welcoming to minorities by answering the following questions:   
- What are the average salaries for each gender by industry
- What are the average salaries for each gender with a college education by industry
- What are the average salaries for each race by industry
- What are the average salaries for each race with a college education by industry

Note: the definition of a minority in this presentation is not male and white.

# Analysis
## Gender

- The average salary for males is $114,714, $88,539 for females, and $76,670 for non-binaries. 
- Salaries for males are highest, followed by females and last by non-binaries. This is evident in all industries. 
- An interesting question that I could not answer is, "Are the salaries for non-binary the lowest because they are younger than the other genders?"

<br>
- The average salary with a four-year college degree is $113,326 for males, $84,145 for females, and $77,614 for non-binaries.
- The computer and tech industry salaries for non-binaries are higher than for females; this is the only industry where that is true.

## Race
### For All Education Levels

- Whites are not the highest paid in any industry.
- In nine industries, "Asian or Asian Americans" or "Middle Eastern or Northern African" are the highest paid.
- Native Americans are the highest paid in the utilities and telecommunications industry and the lowest in many other industries.
- The salaries for all races are nearly equal in the government and education categories, probably due to strong adherence to equal opportunity rules.

### For College Educated

<br><br>

- Salaries for "Middle Eastern or Northern African" are much higher in the "media and digital," retail, and "transport or logistic" industries.
- The salaries for all races are nearly equal again in the government and education industries, probably due to strong adherence to equal opportunity rules.

# Conclusion
Females and non-binaries earn less than males in all industries, and having a higher education does not change this. 
<br><br>
Whites do not earn more than any other race in any industry. Government jobs are the best place for equality for males and females, but not non-binaries. Government and education jobs are the best industries to find equal pay for all races.
