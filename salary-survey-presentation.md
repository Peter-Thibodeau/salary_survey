# What industries offer the best pay for minorities?
To find the industries that are most welcoming to minorities, I will answer the following questions:   
1. What are the average salaries for each gender by industry
2. What are the average salaries for each gender with a college education by industry
3. What are the average salaries for each race by industry
4. What are the average salaries for each race with a college education by industry

Note: The users in the data are considered minorities if they are not white males.

# Observations
Having a college education raises minority and white male salaries by roughly the same amount.
## Gender
- Male salaries are highest in all industries, followed by females and non-binaries.
- An interesting question is, "Are non-binary salaries low because they are usually younger than the other genders?"
- Non-binary salaries are slightly higher than female salaries in the computer and tech industry. Is that because non-binaries are younger (and more tech-savvy) than females?
## Race
- Whites are not the highest paid in any industry.
- Salaries for "Asian or Asian American" and "Middle Eastern or Northern African" are much higher in the "media and digital," retail, and "transport or logistic" industries.
- Native Americans are the highest paid in the utilities and telecommunications industry but the lowest in many other industries.

# Conclusion
Salaries for minorities are highest in the government and education industries, probably due to strong adherence to equal opportunity laws.
