# Welcome
Using the data from a table of salary survy data, we will find the industries that are most welcoming to minorities by answering the following questions:   
- What are the average salaries for each gender by industry
- What are the average salaries for each gender with a college education by industry
- What are the average salaries for each race by industry
- What are the average salaries for each race with a college education by industry

Note: the definition of a minority in this presentation is anyone who in not male and white.

- The average salary for males is $114,714, $88,539 for females, and $76,670 for non-binaries. 
- Salaries for males are highest, followed by females and lasty by non-binaries. This evident in all the industries. 
- An interesting question that I could not answer is "are the salaries for non-binary the lowest because they are younger than the other genders?"
