# Observations
Minorities with a college education raises their salaries by as much as for white Males.
## Gender
- Male salaries are highest in all industries, followed by Females and Non-Binaries.
- Non-Binary salaries are slightly higher than Female salaries in the computer and tech industry.
## Race
- Whites are not the highest paid in any industry.
- Salaries for "Asian or Asian American" and "Middle Eastern or Northern African" are much higher in the "media and digital," retail, and "transport or logistic" industries.
- Native Americans are the highest paid in the utilities and telecommunications industry but the lowest in many other industries.

# Conclusion
Salary differences between genders are evident, with Females earning less than Males. Non-binaries earn less than Females in every industry except "computing or tech." Is that because Non-Binaries are younger (and more tech-savvy) than Females?

Salary differences between races do not favor white Males, showing that there has been significant progress in not just closing the "gap" but exceeding it. It is a shame that the same cannot be said for gender differences.

Salaries for all minorities are highest in the government and education industries, probably due to strong adherence to equal opportunity laws, which is noble. However, there is a lot of room for improvement in other industries.
