# What industries offer the best pay for minorities?
To find the industries that are most welcoming to minorities, I will answering the following questions:   
1. What are the average salaries for each gender by industry
2. What are the average salaries for each gender with a college education by industry
3. What are the average salaries for each race by industry
4. What are the average salaries for each race with a college education by industry

Note: The users in the data are considered minorities if they are not white males.

# Observations
## Gender
- Salaries for males are highest in all industries, followed by females and then non-binaries. This is true whether they have a college education or not.
- An interesting question is, "Are the salaries for non-binary low because they are usually younger than the other genders?"
- Salaries for non-binaries are higher than for females in the computer and tech industry. Is that because non-binaries are youger than females?
## Race
- Whites are not the highest paid in any industry, regardless of having a college education.
- Salaries for "Middle Eastern or Northern African" are much higher in the "media and digital," retail, and "transport or logistic" industries, regardless of having a college education.
- Native Americans are the highest paid in the utilities and telecommunications industry, but the lowest in many other industries, regardless of having a college education.

# Conclusion
Salaries for minorities are best in the government and education industries, probably due to strong adherence to equal opportunity laws.
